# Digital Optic Microscope Project

## Overview
This project showcases the design and manufacturing of a **Digital Optic Microscope**, a device that allows users to observe biological samples using the camera of an iPhone. The project was completed over an 8-week period and involved CAD design, manufacturing processes, and assembly of 8 key components.

## Acknowledgments
This project was completed at University of California, Davis during the Winter 2023 term.

Note:
This project was completed in early 2023. While most of the SolidWorks CAD files and parts are included, a few components from the original assembly are missing. The provided files showcase the primary design and manufacturing processes.
